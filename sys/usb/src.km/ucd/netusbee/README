- The controller has an "over-current protection" mode that disable the USB
  ports when over-current condition exists. With the NetUSBee one of the ports 
  gets disable as soon as the power is on, it’s necessary to disable this 
  protection mode or to force ports to be always powered (see bit 
  NoPowerSwitching in HcRhDescriptorA register).
  Something looks wrong at the hardware level?.
